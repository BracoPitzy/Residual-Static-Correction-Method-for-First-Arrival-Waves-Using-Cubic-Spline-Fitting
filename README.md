# Residual-Static-Correction-Method-for-First-Arrival-Waves-Using-Cubic-Spline-Fitting

# Abstract
This article aims to explore the method of using spline curves to fit the first arrival times of seismic waves and separate disturbances. Firstly, based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, this paper concludes that the optimal solution satisfying the smoothness requirement of the fitting curve is a cubic spline curve, and provides the derivative conditions that the spline curve should satisfy. Subsequently, based on these conditions, this paper establishes a system of linear equations using the three-moment method. By utilizing the KKT conditions, it is obtained that the Lagrange multiplier λ should lie on the boundary of the constraint, and then the approximate range of λ is obtained through bisection method, and it is discretized to calculate the first arrival time curves on different lines corresponding to different firing points, determining the total disturbance at each receiving point. In the third part, this paper further establishes a linear model to separate the disturbances at each firing point from those at each receiving point. Finally, this paper plots a three-dimensional graph of the random disturbances at all firing and receiving points based on coordinates.
